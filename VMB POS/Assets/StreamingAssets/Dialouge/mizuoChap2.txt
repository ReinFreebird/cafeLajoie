NULL#I'm looking at clock, and it's already 9 A.M.#0 
NULL#Usually I'm at my desk working as a receptionist at some small company.#0
NULL#But today I have the day-off, so I can do anything.#0
NULL#Wonder what should I do this afternoon.#0
NULL#I'll probably go out just to have lunch later.#0
NULL#Where should I eat?#0
NULL#"..."#0
NULL#A certain place came up in my mind.#0
NULL#No, not a place.#0
NULL#But someone...#0
NULL#"But... Would he want to see me again now?"#0

NULL#2 Months Later...#0
NULL#I decided visit the cafe again.#0
NULL#It's been a while since I go there.#0
NULL#Many people on the way to go there now.#0
NULL#"Maybe the cafe became famous somehow."#0
NULL#I try to walk toward the entrance with a bit of effort.#0
NULL#It's hard to get through this amount of peoples standing.#0
NULL#And when I get there...#0
F#Play_Music#1
NULL#Goosebumped, feeling that's so weird I can't even explain.#0
NULL#I realize the cafe had been replaced with new building.#0
NULL#My feet started to feel so heavy.#0
NULL#It's like the ground is trying to pull me down.#0
NULL#I gave in as the weight becoming too much for me to handle.#0
NULL#The Cafe, 'Cafe Lajoie', is no more...#0
NULL#Why does it has to close like this?#0
NULL#How come did I not know what happened?#0
NULL#Is there any way...?#0
NULL#I could fix it?#0
