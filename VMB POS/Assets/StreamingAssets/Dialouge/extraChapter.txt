NULL#6 AM, Shopping District.#0
NULL#It's morning. The sun is barely up yet.#0
NULL#It's pretty lonely here.#0
NULL#Not a lot of people came to the shopping district this early.#0
NULL#As for me, this has become my routine for almost two years already.#0
NULL#Ever since I left home and live alone in the city, I've been fighting every day just to stay alive.#0
NULL#The first 3 months here I couldn't get a job.#0
NULL#I knew I couldn't keep it that way, so I did what I could do.#0
NULL#I decided to start my own business.#0
NULL#Got a leverage from a friend working at a bank to help me get some loan money.#0
NULL#And so, start a business I did.#0
NULL#A small cafe, in a very crowded shopping district.#0
NULL#Cafe Lajoie.#0
NULL#...#0
NULL#At this point you're probably had enough of hearing that.#0
NULL#Not gonna bother explaining that anything further.#0
NULL#So anyways...#0
NULL#It is now my obligation to keep the business going.#0
NULL#I started it in the first place.#0
NULL#And so,it's only natural for me to come here early every day.#0
NULL#Only after a minute of walk, I've arrived at the front of the cafe.#0
NULL#No one's is inside yet, that much is not surprising.#0
NULL#"..heeyy..."#0
NULL#There is something surprising though...#0
NULL#I heard a familiar voice calling out to me.#0
NULL#It couldn't be anyone else.#0

00_Miyuki#"Good morning, Master."#0
01_Mizuo#"Ah, morning."#0
NULL#It really is them.#0
NULL#These are my employees.#0
NULL#Wait, it's not right calling them that.#0
NULL#Ally? Peer? Comrade?#0
NULL#Well, you could say they are my most trusted people.#0
NULL#Miyuki the waiter, and Mizuo the Chef.#0
NULL#They have been there since this cafe opened.#0
NULL#In fact, they are the only ones that are still here with me.#0
NULL#From the start, until now.#0
NULL#I knew it would be tough running a business only with will and guts.#0
NULL#Even so, I went through it, we all did.#0
NULL#Not a lot of people came here.#0
NULL#The money we got each month are barely enough to pay these two, let alone getting a profit out of it.#0
NULL#Paying up loan money is a whole another story, not gonna go there today.#0
NULL#It was never a fine day, you know how it feel when nothing is going right for you?#0
NULL#That happened to me.#0
NULL#Things got from bad to worse for almost a year.#0
NULL#We barely got any customer.#0
NULL#We almost had to close up business just to keep this ship afloat.#0
NULL#Does that even make any sense?.#0
NULL#I don't even know, not that I care anymore.#0
NULL#So yeah...#0
NULL#...#0
00_Miyuki#"How are you this morning?"#0
01_Mizuo#"Well you know him, nothing stops our main man."#0
NULL#Suddenly things finally turned for the best.#0
NULL#People starts coming, money starts flowing.#0
NULL#How could this had happen actually?.#0
NULL#I don't know, let's just call it 'Deus Ex Machine'.#0
NULL#If this continues, we might break even by the end of next year.#0
NULL#But we can't just pull our leg from the pedals just yet.#0
NULL#I have to keep doing my best.#0
NULL#For the customers, for these too as well.#0
00_Miyuki#"Hope you're ready today, there will be a lot of customers coming today"#0
01_Mizuo#"We're ready anytime, just say the word."#0
NULL#Yes, I could have give up a long time ago.#0
NULL#But I didn't.#0
NULL#Yes, I could just go back to my family.#0
NULL#But I didn't.#0
NULL#You know why?#0
NULL#Because it's my choice.#0
NULL#I choose this live, and I'm intended to see it through.#0
NULL#I knew everything is going to be okay.#0
NULL#And when it does, I knew I  would be the happiest man in the world.#0
NULL#Because through all these...#0
NULL#...I did it, in mind that because I choose it.#0
NULL#I lived my life the way I want it.#0
NULL#I did it my way.#0
NULL#That's all I could ever hope in my life.#0
NULL#Nothing more, nothing less.#0
